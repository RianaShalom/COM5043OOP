# COM5043 Object Oriented Programming 

SCENARIO: Warehouse Management System for BNU Industry Solutions Ltd.

Company Background: BNU Industry Solutions Ltd. is a leading provider of industrial equipment and supplies serving clients across various sectors including manufacturing, construction, and logistics. As the business grows, the company faces challenges in managing its warehouse operations efficiently.

Current Challenges:
1. Inventory Tracking: The company struggles with accurately tracking stock levels, leading to
overstocking or stockouts.
2. Order Fulfilment: Processing orders manually is time-consuming and prone to errors, affecting
customer satisfaction.
3. Supplier Coordination: Managing supplier information and orders is cumbersome, resulting in
delays and miscommunications.

Objective: To address these challenges, BNU Industry Solutions Ltd. decides to implement a new Warehouse Management System (WMS) that will streamline operations, improve accuracy, and enhance overall efficiency.

Key Features of the Warehouse Management System:
1. Supplier Management:
* Maintain basic supplier information, including contact details and order history.
* Implement features to add, update, and delete supplier records.
* Create purchase orders for new inventory, track order status, and manage deliveries.

2. Inventory Management:
* Track and manage stock levels.
* Receive new inventory and update stock quantities.
* Monitor low stock alerts to prevent stockouts.

3. Order Processing:
* Process customer orders, and update inventory levels accordingly.

4. Simple Financial Accounts:
* Track financial transactions related to inventory purchases and sales.
* Generate basic financial reports such as sales summaries and expense reports

Design, Implementation and Testing (Individual Work - 100 marks)

Based on the scenario above, design and implement the system using object-oriented techniques using an
appropriate object-oriented language (e.g. Java, C#, C++, Python, TypeScript).

On the expectation that the system will grow into a larger and more complex system, use the chosen languageâ€™s type system, or type annotations, to minimise the likelihood of runtime errors.

Your system will require a user interface to drive the system. This can be either a text based / menu driven interface or a graphical interface. Your system should be structured such that the user interface is decoupled from the business logic.

Note: The assessment will focus on functional behaviour and program structure, rather that the frontend user interface. A text-based interface may be easier to implement than an event driven / graphical one.
